Our datasets for this project were obtained through kaggle.com
They are Spotify datasets that contain a list of the most popular songs and their corresponding features from 2010 to 2019, and 2020. 

# Goals 
Our goals for this analysis are the following:
1. Discover the most popular genres
2. Determine the most popular artists
3. Compare audio features and how they have changed over time
4. Analyze how 2020 impacted the type of music we listened to.

# Description of Audio Features
1. Tempo(Beats Per Minute) - The tempo of the song.
2. Energy - The energy of a song - the higher the value, the more energetic the song.
3. Danceability - The higher the value, the more danceable the song.
4. Loudness - This specifies the loudness of the song in decibels(dB)
5. Valence - This describes the mood of the song. The higher the value, the more positive a song is said to be in terms of mood.
6. Acousticness - This is a measure of a song's distinctiveness in the sound waves produced. Acoustic is a quality that determines the ability of an enclosure (such as an auditorium) to reflect sound waves in such a way as to produce distinct hearing.
7. Popularity - This is a rating of how popular a song is. This is determined by metrics on the Spotify platform.
8. Duration - This is the length of the song in seconds.
