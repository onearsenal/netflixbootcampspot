<h1>Netflix Bootcamp Project 2</h1>
<h2>Extract, Transform, Load</span></h2> 

In this project, 4 tables are given from which new tables are to be produced based on the criteria outlined below:

<ol>
<li>An actors table with unique actors and actress' names that also contains a numerical field for age
and a boolean field to identify if the actor or actress is currently alive, deceased, or unknown.</li>
<li>A film table that:
<ul>
<li>Contains a character field for the original title, a numerical field for the 
average critic rating.</li> 
<li>A character field for the type of film (movie, television show, etc.)</li>
<li>A datetime field that has the runtime of the film in HH:MM (hours then minutes, separted by a colon) format.</li></ul>
In addition to the required fields, there should be additional fields for other relevant metadata.</li>
<li>A producers table that contains only producer's names and links to the film table.</li>
<li>A characters table with unique character names that links the actors and film tables together.</li>
</ol>

<li>The code for this project was written in Google Colab and can be found in <a href="https://github.com/Anino1996/Project2---Group3/blob/Main/Project_2_Group1.ipynb">Project_2_Group1.ipynb</a>.</li>

<li>An <a href="https://github.com/Anino1996/Project2---Group3/blob/Main/ERD_Diagram.png">entity relationship diagram (ERD_Diagram.png)</a> detailing how the created tables relate to each other was then made via quickdatabasediagrams.com</li>


<li> Finally, <a href="https://github.com/Anino1996/Project2---Group3/blob/Main/Project%202%20Presentation.pdf">a presentation</a>, detailing the key methodologies and implementation applied in arriving at these solutions, was prepared and presented on April 09, 2021.
